[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Kodi Library Information[/B][/COLOR]
[I]If you have local items in your Kodi library, then you can access them in David through the Kodi Library menu. There are also menus for your Recently Added Movies/Episodes from the kodi library. This allows you to playback these titles through David, utilizing David's trakt support and other features. David will scrape the Kodi library if that scraper is enabled and provide it as a source in the results. You can also set David to search the Kodi library BEFORE it scrapes from other providers, giving you the option to play a local file before searching elsewhere. In Autoplay, David will automatically play a local file/downloaded file. With Kodi Library Integration, you can do all your viewing in one place.[/I]
