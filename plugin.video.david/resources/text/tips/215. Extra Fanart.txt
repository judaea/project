[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Extra Fanart[/B][/COLOR]
[I]David uses the davidmeta module to provide metadata for Movies/TV Shows. By default, davidmeta does not provide extra fanart. To enable this, and start displaying banners, clearart and clearlogo within your skin (where supported by skin), turn on 'Include Extra Art' in the davidmeta settings. You can navigate to the davidmeta settings through David by going to Settings->Open Davidmeta Settings. If you have a fanart.tv API key (please consider getting one to support fanart.tv), you can also enter that in the davidmeta settings. Try it out to see...[/I]
