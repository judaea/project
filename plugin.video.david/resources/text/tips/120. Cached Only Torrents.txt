[I]If you have a debrid account with Real-Debrid and/or Premiumize and/or All-Debrid, you can now choose to show only cached torrents in David. Simply Authorize you debrid accounts in Settings->Accounts, enable cached torrents only in Settings->Results->Torrents Sorting & Filtering->Show Cached Torrents Only. Now David will show only torrents cached on those services.[/I]
