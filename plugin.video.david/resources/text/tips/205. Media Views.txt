[I]In Tools->Set Views you can set the desired views for Movies, TV Shows etc so that they will honor that view when navigating through David.
Set "Delay for Setting Viewtype" in Settings->General->Navigation to adjust the delay before David sets the view type (needed for Kodi 18). The more powerful the device you use, the shorter delay you can set.[/I]
